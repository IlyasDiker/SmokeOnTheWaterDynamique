# SmokeOnTheWaterDynamique
A dynamic version of my old project SmokeOnTheWater

thanks to my friend [Saad Kardoudi](https://github.com/Saad-kardoudi) for helping me on the small project

Just a simple school project to practice not something professional.

**Smoke on the Water** is a pharmacy located on the Vespucci Beach Sidewalk, Vespucci Beach in *Los Santos*. It sells prescription marijuana for "medical" purposes.
